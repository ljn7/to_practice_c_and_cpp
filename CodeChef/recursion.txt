Asymptotic notations just understand it clearly
you dont have to do anything with log
there is no math
the only math you need is when you "Simply the time complexity of a Recurrsion algorithm"

[8:34 PM]
Mikasa Ackerman:
	oh
	to calculate worst case scenario only?

[8:35 PM]
ЯøçA®:
	no no
	its not liek that
	you dont even worry about it
	its prolly just in engineering
	or im not sure
	Analysis of Recursion in Programming
	In this blog, we will analyze the recursive algorithm using Recurrence Tree Method, Master theorem. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of recursion.

	before the topic of
	in this link
	search for
	Analyzing the Efficiency of Recursive Algorithms
	just scroll till before Pros and Cons of recursive programming
	> before the topic of ignore this line, mistyped
	i'll tell you all later at night
	im going out now

[8:36 PM]
Mikasa Ackerman:
	Okay

[8:36 PM]
ЯøçA®:
	we'll play dota at night maybe if i have time
	when u sleep ?

[8:37 PM]
Mikasa Ackerman:
	before 12 or 12:30

[8:37 PM]
ЯøçA®:
	Method 1: Recursion Tree MethodMethod 2: Master theorem
	These 2 methods are there
	if you have these methods in syllabus, only then you need to worry
	but even if it is there, it is like basic algebra
	you still dont have to worry
	if i play 1 or 2 before 12:30
	i sleep by 12:30 too

[8:38 PM]
Mikasa Ackerman:
	oh
	Okay
